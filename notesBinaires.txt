DÃ©but : AC64 pour le 64 bits
		AC32 pour le 32 bits

Opperations 64 bits : 
    oppeands are coded on 10 bits
    There are 64 registers so register nomes are coded on 6 bits

    0x300 : MOV reg NUM(48)
            Set the value of reg to a numeral value

    Ox3FF : DSP reg
            Print the content of reg    

Function call : 
    Execution : IDK...
Linking :
    An other linked list where each member got : the name of the label, the position of the label, a bool stating wheather or not the label has already be placed. For the ease of use I will used the code struct as the list.
